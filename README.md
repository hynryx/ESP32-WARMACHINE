## Requirements

- **ESP32 Development Board** (ESP32-WROOM-32, ESP32 DevKit v1, etc.)
- **VSCode** (With PlatformIO extension)
- **CP2102 Driver** (Linux already has this driver in its kernel)
## Installation

### Using PlatformIO (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hynryx/ESP32-WARMACHINE.git
   cd ESP32-WARMACHINE
   ```

2. **Open in VSCode (make sure you have been installed PlatformIO extension)**

3. **Upload to ESP32**

##  Usage

1. **Power on the ESP32** - It will create a WiFi Access Point
2. **Connect to the AP:**
   - **SSID:** `ESP32-Warmachine` (default)
   - **Password:** `12345678` (default)
3. **Open web browser** and navigate to: `http://192.168.4.1`
4. **Scan for networks** using the "Scan Networks" button
5. **Select target network** from the list
6. **Choose deauth reason code**
7. **Launch attack** or use "Deauth All" for broader impact

## Configuration

Edit `include/definitions.h` to customize:

```cpp
#define AP_SSID "ESP32-Warmachine"    // Access Point name
#define AP_PASS "12345678"          // Access Point password
#define CHANNEL_MAX 13              // Maximum WiFi channel
// #define LED 2                    // Uncomment to enable LED (if you have one)
// #define SERIAL_DEBUG             // Uncomment for serial output
```
